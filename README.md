This Java program takes a look at different algorithms that memory allocation can use to make the most out of memory allocation and reusing free memory. 

There are 3 different algorithms:
Best Fit - finds the most efficient block of memory to allocate
First Fit - finds the first block of memory available that fits allocation needs
Worst Fit - finds the biggest set of free space to allocate memory
